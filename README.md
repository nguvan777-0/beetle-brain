# beetle-brain

Neuroevolution sim where the organism is its weights, accelerated via CoreML on Apple Silicon (numpy fallback included). We're evolving weights called wights. Each wight's brain is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) — hidden state carries across ticks, enabling memory to evolve.

- **Encoded** (genome, evolves): speed, fov, size, color, mouth, pred_ratio, mutation rates, HGT rates, epigenetic carry-over, active neurons, n_rays — 20 floats decoded via sigmoid.
- **Derived** (our rules, does not evolve): `energy_max = 10 × size²` (storage ∝ volume), `drain = 0.015 × size^0.75` (Kleiber's law).
- **Emergent**: predator/prey dimorphism, camouflage arms races, lineage divergence, and spatial memory — nothing encodes these, they appear.

## the wight

Each wight is ~2,294 floats: 20 body weights (W_body), 1,152 for the first brain layer (36 inputs × 32 max hidden), 64 for the second (32 hidden × 2 outputs), 1,024 for the hidden-to-hidden recurrent layer (32 × 32), and 34 bias weights (b1: 32, b2: 2). All decoded from the same array via sigmoid. Starts with 12 wights (a primordial soup). Everything else emerges.

Each ray returns 5 channels: food distance, organism distance, and the organism's r/g/b color. Up to 7 rays per wight, giving 35 ray inputs + 1 energy = 36 total inputs. The number of active rays (0–7) is an evolvable gene — a blind wight costs nothing on sensing.

Wights ray-cast through a rasterized world grid — O(N) total regardless of population size. Sensing and predation both use the same grid: sensing ray-marches through it, predation reads a fixed patch around each wight. Food spawns near hydrothermal vents with 1/r² density — dense at the vent centre, sparse at the edge. Sensing and brain run fused in a single GPU dispatch (O(1) wall-clock regardless of population size) via a CoreML program that ray-marches and runs the Elman RNN in one kernel.

## Genome: 20 evolving traits

All traits are decoded from `W_body` (20 floats) via sigmoid into their ranges. `energy_max` and `drain` are derived from `size` (not genes).

| Gene | Trait | Role |
|------|-------|------|
| 0 | `speed` | base movement speed |
| 1 | `fov` | field of view width |
| 2 | `ray_len` | sensing range |
| 3 | `size` | body radius — drives `energy_max = scale × size²` and `drain = scale × size^0.75` |
| 4–6 | `r`, `g`, `b` | body color (camouflage axis) |
| 7 | `turn_s` | turning speed |
| 8 | `breed_at` | energy threshold to reproduce (r/K axis) |
| 9 | `clone_with` | energy given to offspring |
| 10 | `mutation_rate` | per-weight mutation probability |
| 11 | `mutation_scale` | mutation step size |
| 12 | `epigenetic` | fraction of parent RNN state inherited |
| 13 | `weight_decay` | vestigial — no longer applied |
| 14 | `mouth` | food reach radius |
| 15 | `pred_ratio` | size multiplier required to predate (1.05–2.0×) |
| 16 | `hgt_eat_rate` | probability of incorporating prey DNA on a kill |
| 17 | `hgt_contact_rate` | probability of gene exchange on proximity contact |
| 18 | `active_neurons` | number of live hidden neurons (0–32) — brain capacity |
| 19 | `n_rays` | number of active rays (0–7) — 0 = completely blind |

## How evolution works

- eat food → gain energy (split among all eaters touching the same food)
- touch something smaller (`pred_ratio × your size`) → eat it, gain 30% of its energy
- on a kill, roll against `hgt_eat_rate` → single-point crossover your genome with the prey's
- on proximity contact, roll against `hgt_contact_rate` → same crossover with a neighbor
- hit `breed_at` energy → clone + mutate all weights (W_body, W1, W2, Wh, b1, b2), reset to `clone_with`
- hit 0 energy → die
- metabolic drain: `DRAIN_SCALE × size^0.75 + speed² × SPEED_TAX + size² × SIZE_TAX + ray_len × fov × SENSING_TAX` per tick
- population capped at 4096 (keeps youngest generations on overflow)
- extinction → game over screen with restart

## The endgame: a wightcat

The goal is to scale the environment, metabolic systems, and cognitive capacity until the sim can support a **wightcat**: a complex apex predator with spatial reasoning and pursuit.

Life thrives at the boundary between states—rivers, coastlines, and thermal vents. By blasting energy into localized regions of the world, we create the harsh ecological gradients necessary to force complex behavioral adaptations.

## Run

```bash
uv run --with numpy --with pygame --with coremltools --with plotly python world.py
```

Without pygame — runs headless at max speed for N seconds (default 30):

```bash
uv run --with numpy --with coremltools --with plotly python world.py 60
```

`plotly` is optional — drop it and the report is skipped. `coremltools` is optional — drop it and the brain runs on numpy instead.

First run compiles two CoreML models (~1–2s each), cached to `build/brain.mlpackage` and `build/sense_brain.mlpackage`.

**Keys:** `SPACE` cycle speed (1×/5×/20×/100×) · `L` load · `R` restart · `click` inspect wight · `ESC` quit (auto-saves, generates report)

## run report

Generates `report.html` on exit (ESC, quit, or extinction). Open in any browser — fully offline.

- **lineage tree** — forks over time, node size = dominance, color = phylo hue
- **genome heatmap** — all 18 genes × time, normalized within each gene's range
- **phase scatter** — size vs pred_ratio at final snapshot, colored by lineage
- **drain breakdown** — Kleiber + speed² + size² + sensing cost, stacked
- **hall of fame** — longest-lived, most ate, highest generation
