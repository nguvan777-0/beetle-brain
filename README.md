# beetle-brain

Neuroevolution sim where the organism is its weights, accelerated via CoreML on Apple Silicon (numpy fallback included). We're evolving weights called wights. Each wight's brain is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) — inherited at birth, mutated like the body, shaped entirely by selection.

- **Encoded** (genome, evolved): speed, fov, size, color, mouth, pred_ratio, mutation rates, HGT rates, epigenetic carry-over — 18 floats decoded via sigmoid.
- **Derived** (our rules, not evolved): `energy_max = 10 × size²` (storage ∝ volume), `drain = 0.015 × size^0.75` (Kleiber's law).
- **Emergent**: predator/prey dimorphism, camouflage arms race, lineage divergence, horizontal gene flow — nothing encodes these, they appear.

## the wight

Each wight is ~213 floats: 18 body weights, 180 for the first brain layer, 24 for the second. All decoded from the same array via sigmoid. Starts with 12 wights (a primordial soup). Everything else emerges.

Wights ray-cast through a rasterized world grid — O(N) total regardless of population size. Sensing and predation both use the same grid: sensing ray-marches through it, predation reads a fixed patch around each wight. All brains run in a single batched CoreML call (weights passed as runtime inputs, routed to GPU or ANE by the OS).

## Genome: 18 evolved traits

All traits are decoded from `W_body` (18 floats) via sigmoid into their ranges. `energy_max` and `drain` are derived from `size` (not genes).

| Gene | Trait | Role |
|------|-------|------|
| 0 | `speed` | base movement speed |
| 1 | `fov` | field of view width |
| 2 | `ray_len` | sensing range |
| 3 | `size` | body radius — drives `energy_max = scale × size²` and `drain = scale × size^0.75` |
| 4–6 | `r`, `g`, `b` | body color (camouflage axis) |
| 7 | `turn_s` | turning speed |
| 8 | `breed_at` | energy threshold to reproduce (r/K axis) |
| 9 | `clone_with` | energy given to offspring |
| 10 | `mutation_rate` | per-weight mutation probability |
| 11 | `mutation_scale` | mutation step size |
| 12 | `epigenetic` | fraction of parent RNN state inherited |
| 13 | `weight_decay` | vestigial — no longer applied |
| 14 | `mouth` | food reach radius |
| 15 | `pred_ratio` | size multiplier required to predate (1.05–2.0×) |
| 16 | `hgt_eat_rate` | probability of incorporating prey DNA on a kill |
| 17 | `hgt_contact_rate` | probability of gene exchange on proximity contact |

## How evolution works

- eat food → gain energy (split among all eaters touching the same food)
- touch something smaller (`pred_ratio × your size`) → eat it, gain 30% of its energy
- on a kill, roll against `hgt_eat_rate` → single-point crossover your genome with the prey's
- on proximity contact, roll against `hgt_contact_rate` → same crossover with a neighbor
- hit `breed_at` energy → clone + mutate all weights (W_body, W1, W2), reset to `clone_with`
- hit 0 energy → die
- metabolic drain: `DRAIN_SCALE × size^0.75 + speed² × SPEED_TAX + size² × SIZE_TAX + ray_len × fov × SENSING_TAX` per tick
- population capped at 4096 (keeps youngest generations on overflow)
- extinction → game over screen with restart

## Run

```bash
uv run --with numpy --with pygame --with coremltools python world.py
```

First run compiles the CoreML brain model (~1s), cached to `build/brain.mlpackage`.

**Headless** (no pygame needed):

```bash
uv run --with numpy --with coremltools --with plotly python run_headless.py 30
```

Runs for 30 seconds at max speed, printing population stats every 500 ticks. Writes `report.html` on completion.

**Keys:** `SPACE` cycle speed (1×/5×/20×/headless) · `L` load · `R` restart · `click` inspect wight · `ESC` quit (auto-saves, generates report)

## run report

Both the headless run and the pygame sim generate `report.html` on exit (ESC, quit, or extinction). Open it in any browser — fully offline, no CDN.

- **lineage river** — stacked area per lineage colored by phylo hue. forks, takeovers, and extinctions visible at a glance
- **genome heatmap** — all 18 genes × time, normalized within each gene's range. selection vs neutral drift in one view
- **phase scatter** — size vs pred_ratio at the final snapshot, colored by lineage, sized by speed
- **drain breakdown** — Kleiber + speed² + size² + sensing cost, stacked per tick
- **hall of fame** — longest-lived, most kills, highest generation with full trait snapshot and lineage hue
